# Stall Management Blocking/Unblocking Fix Test

## Issue Fixed
Fixed the issue where admin could not select blocked stalls for unblocking in the stall management system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Grid View Fix (Line 316)
**Before:**
```jsx
disabled={getStallStatus(stall.id) !== 'available'}
```
**After:**
```jsx
disabled={getStallStatus(stall.id) === 'booked'}
```

### 2. List View Fix (Line 403)
**Before:**
```jsx
disabled={status !== 'available'}
```
**After:**
```jsx
disabled={status === 'booked'}
```

## Behavior Analysis

### Admin Side (After Fix):
- ✅ Can select **available** stalls for blocking
- ✅ Can select **blocked** stalls for unblocking  
- ❌ Cannot select **booked** stalls (correct behavior - booking takes precedence)

### User Side (StallMap.jsx - No Change Needed):
- ✅ Can select **available** stalls for booking
- ❌ Cannot select **blocked** stalls (correct security behavior)
- ❌ Cannot select **booked** stalls (correct behavior)

## Test Steps

1. **Admin Blocks a Stall:**
   - Go to Admin Stall Management
   - Select an available stall
   - Click "Block Stalls" button
   - Verify stall turns red and shows as "Blocked"

2. **Admin Unblocks the Stall:**
   - Select the previously blocked stall (should now be selectable)
   - Click "Unblock Stalls" button
   - Verify stall turns green and shows as "Available"

3. **User Cannot Select Blocked Stalls:**
   - Go to user stall booking page
   - Try to click on a blocked stall
   - Verify it shows an alert and cannot be selected

## Security Check
- Users cannot unblock stalls from their side ✅
- Users cannot select blocked stalls for booking ✅
- Only admins can manage stall blocking/unblocking ✅

## Fix Status: COMPLETE ✅
The unblocking functionality now works correctly in admin stall management.
