# Stall Booking Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved:

### 1. **Admin-blocked stalls being released by cleanup** âœ… FIXED
**Root Cause:** The admin stall management was not setting the `blockedReason: 'Blocked by admin'` field that the cleanup service looks for.

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `StallManagement.jsx` line 214 to add `blockedReason: 'Blocked by admin'` when blocking stalls
- Modified `StallManagement.jsx` line 223 to clear `blockedReason: null` when unblocking stalls
- Now admin-blocked stalls are properly protected from automatic cleanup

### 2. **Automatic cleanup not running every 2 minutes** âœ… FIXED
**Root Cause:** The stall cleanup hook was initialized in `StallMap.jsx` which is only rendered when the user is on step 1 of the booking flow. When users navigate to other steps (vendor details, payment), the cleanup service stops.

**Fix Applied:**
- Moved stall cleanup hook from `StallMap.jsx` to the main stall booking page (`/src/app/(bookings)/booking/stall/page.jsx`)
- The cleanup now runs continuously throughout the entire stall booking session
- Removed cleanup hook from `StallMap.jsx` to prevent duplicate cleanup services

## How the Fixes Work:

### Admin Protection Logic:
```javascript
// In stallCleanupService.js line 40-42
if (stallData.blockedReason === 'Blocked by admin') {
  console.log(`ðŸš« Stall ${stallId} is admin-blocked - NEVER cleanup`);
  continue; // Skip this stall entirely
}
```

### Continuous Cleanup Service:
- Now initialized at the page level, not component level
- Runs every 2 minutes regardless of which step the user is on
- Maintains cleanup even when navigating between stall selection, vendor details, and payment

## Verification:
1. **Admin blocks are protected:** Admin-blocked stalls now include `blockedReason: 'Blocked by admin'` and are skipped by cleanup
2. **Continuous cleanup:** Cleanup service runs from page load and continues throughout the booking session
3. **User experience:** No need to refresh the page - cleanup happens automatically in the background

## Files Modified:
1. `src/app/(bookings)/booking/stall/page.jsx` - Added stall cleanup hook
2. `src/components/stall/StallMap.jsx` - Removed stall cleanup hook
3. `src/components/admin/StallManagement.jsx` - Added `blockedReason` field for admin blocks

Both issues are now resolved and the stall booking system has the same level of reliability as the havan seat booking system.
