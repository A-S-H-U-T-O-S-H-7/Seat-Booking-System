/**
 * Scenario test descriptions for manual verification:
 * 
 * 1. Admin-Blocked Seats Protection:
 *    - Admin blocks a seat with blockedReason: 'Blocked by admin'
 *    - Cleanup service should NEVER release this seat
 *    - Verify seat remains blocked after multiple cleanup runs
 * 
 * 2. Payment Processing Blocks:
 *    - User selects seats and initiates payment (seats get blocked with expiryTime)
 *    - If payment succeeds: seats should be marked as booked (blocked: false, booked: true)
 *    - If payment fails: cleanup service should release seats after expiry
 * 
 * 3. Expired Pending Bookings:
 *    - Booking with status 'pending' and expired expiryTime
 *    - Cleanup should cancel booking and release associated seats
 * 
 * 4. Cancelled Bookings:
 *    - Booking with status 'cancelled'
 *    - Associated seats should be released immediately
 * 
 * 5. Confirmed Bookings:
 *    - Booking with status 'confirmed'
 *    - Seats should remain booked permanently (not cleaned up)
 * 
 * 6. Orphaned Blocks:
 *    - Blocked seats with no bookingId and no blockedReason
 *    - Should be cleaned up as orphaned temporary blocks
