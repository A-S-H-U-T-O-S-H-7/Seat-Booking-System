3. Access: `http://localhost:3000/test-ccavenue-form.html`
4. Click "Create Test Payment" and observe the console

#### Step 2: Test with Minimal Data
```bash
# Test the debug API directly
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/debug-ccavenue" -Method POST -Headers @{"Content-Type" = "application/json"} -Body '{"orderId":"MINIMAL_TEST","amount":"1","billingName":"Test","billingEmail":"test@test.com","billingTel":"9999999999"}'
```

#### Step 3: Check Console Logs

```

  - encRequest length: [should be > 500]
  - access_code: AVYS83MH27BT31SYTB
üìã Form created successfully, submitting...

### 7. **Emergency Debugging Steps**

If still facing issues:

1. **Check Production Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Verify production environment variables are loaded
   echo $CCAVENUE_INDIA_WORKING_KEY  # Should show your working key
   echo $CCAVENUE_INDIA_ACCESS_CODE  # Should show your access code
   ```

2. **Test with CCAvenue Test Credentials** (if you have them):
   - Temporarily switch to test credentials
   - If test works, issue is with production credentials/domain

3. **Contact CCAvenue Support**:
   - Merchant ID: 116662
   - Domain: https://donate.svsamiti.com
   - Error: "Invalid Request - Encrypted request invalid/not present"

   - Test payment with small amount (‚Çπ1)
   - Monitor CCAvenue dashboard for transaction logs
   - Check your server logs during payment attempts

2. If domain needs to be added:
   - Submit domain whitelist request to CCAvenue
   - Wait for approval (24-48 hours)
   - Test again after approval

### 10. **Success Indicators**
